I used functional components and hooks in this projects, since react component are none the less pure functions. Because of its testability. I thought of using 'styled-components' in this project but end up using 'sass'. If this be a big project I would definitely went for 'styled-components' to prevent clashing css.

Since, it is a small projects I made a very few components and didn't break down as it's needed to be. Yes, a lot of improvement can be done. Like making a card component to show the application details and break down each component of its own. And the api call is happening in each component, so I would focus on performance to boost the page.
